	\section{Examples}
	Here are some examples from allaboutcircuits.com.
	\subsection{Example 1}
	Initial values of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R_1, R_2, R_3 = 4, 2, 1 \Omega$
		\item $B_1, B_2 = 28, 7 \text{V}$
	\end{itemize}
	\paragraph[Branch]{Using the Branch Method:}
	There are three unknown currents, each denoted as '$I_1$', '$I_2$', and 
	'$I_3$' respectively.
	\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig:circuit}
		\caption{A complex circuit with two batteries.}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.375\linewidth]{circuit-1}
	\end{figure}
	Note that the polarity of the circuit components are just initial 
	assumptions, which may in fact be incorrect.  These assumptions being 
	incorrect is okay however. \\ \\
	To solve for these unknown values we will use the following three 
	(simultaneous) equations:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:series_1}
		R_1I_1 + R_2I_2 = B_1
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:series_2}
		R_3I_3 + R_2I_2 = B_2
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1--cur_3}
		I_2 = I_1 + I_3
	\end{equation}
	Equation (\ref{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1--cur_3}) is via Kirschoff's Current 
	Law(KCL), which says that:
	$$ I_1 + I_3 - I_2 = 0\text{A}$$
	Note that the sign (i.e. positive or negative) of a symbol denotes the 
	direction of the current, with respect to the node defined by the 
	connection between the currents, whose measure it represents.  In the case 
	of the above equation, the current with a measure of $I_2$ is 
	\emph{exiting} the node, and, as such, '$I_2$' is preceded by a negative 
	sign in the equation derived from KCL.   $I_1$ and $I_3$ are 
	\emph{entering} the node, which is signified by a lack of a negative sign 
	preceding their symbolic representation in equation 
	(\ref{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1--cur_3}).\\ \\
	Via equation (\ref{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1--cur_3}) and substitution, the first 
	two equations 
	can be rewritten as:
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:series_1}}
		R_1I_1 + R_2(I_1 + I_3) = B_1
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:series_2}}
		R_3I_3 + R_2(I_1 + I_3) = B_2
	\end{equation}
	Via equation (\ref{eq:series_1}), we can solve for $I_1$ in terms of $I_3$.
	$$ I_1(R_1 + R_2) = B_1 - R_2I_3$$
	$$ 6 \Omega \cdot I_1 = 28\text{V} - 2 \Omega \cdot I_3$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:cur_1-in-cur_3}
		I_1 = \frac{14}{3}\text{A} - \frac{1}{3}I_3
	\end{equation}
	And, via the above equation, equation (\ref{eq:series_2}), and 
	substitution, we can solve for $I_3$.
	$$ R_3I_3 + R_2 \frac{14\text{A}- I_3 + 3I_3}{3} = R_3I_3 + R_2 
	\frac{14\text{A} + 2I_3}{3} = B_2$$
	$$ 3R_3I_3 + R_2(14\text{A} + 2I_3) = 3B_2$$
	$$ I_3(3R_3 + 2R_2) = 3B_2 - 14\text{A} \cdot R_2$$
	$$ 7\Omega \cdot I_3 = 21\text{V} - 28\text{V} = -7\text{V}$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:cur_3}
		I_3 = -1\text{A}
	\end{equation}
	The fact that we got a negative value for $I_3$ implies that our initial 
	assumption about the polarity of $R_3$ was false.  It actually is the 
	opposite, which also means that $I_3$ is in fact \emph{exiting} the 
	node.
	\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig:circuit-2}
		\caption{Same circuit with reversed polarities for $R_3$.}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.375\linewidth]{complex-2}
	\end{figure}
	This means that equation (\ref{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1--cur_3})  and 
	(\ref{eq:cur_3}) can be rewritten as:
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:cur_3}}
		I_3 = 1\text{A}
	\end{equation}
	$$ I_1-I_2-I_3 =0$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:cur_1-in-cur_2}
		I_1 = I_2 + I_3 = I_2 + 1
	\end{equation}
	Note that even if we ignored the polarities and direction of the current 
	altogether, the magnitude of the currents would be the same. \\ \\
	Equations (1), (2), and (4) also need to be rewritten to reflect the new 
	polarity.
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:series_1}}
		R_1I_1 + R_2(I_1-I_3) = B_1
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:series_2}}
		R_3I_3 + R_2(I_1 - I_3) = B_2
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:cur_1-in-cur_3}}
		I_1 = \frac{1}{3}(14\text{A} + I_3) = \frac{15}{3}\text{A} = 5\text{A}
	\end{equation}
	Finally, via the above equation, equation (\ref{eq:cur_1-in-cur_2}), and 
	substitution,
	$$ I_2 = 5\text{A}-1\text{A}=4\text{A}$$
	\subsection{Example 2}
	Below is a complex circuit that would require 6 branch currents to solve 
	using the branch method.
	\begin{figure}[H]\label{fig:circuit-3}		
		\caption{The Unbalanced Wheatstone Bridge.}

		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.5\linewidth]{circuit-3}
	\end{figure}
	\paragraph[Mesh]{The mesh current method} only requires 3 mesh currents to 
	find the 
	currents flowing through each component and subsequently the voltages 
	running across them. \\ \\
	One of these currents, denoted as '$I_1$', flows clockwise through $R_1$, 
	$R_2$, and $R_3$.  Current $I_2$ flows clockwise through $R_3$, $R_5$, and 
	$R_4$.  And current $I_3$ also flows clockwise through the battery, denoted 
	as '$B_1$', $R_1$, and $R_4$. \\ \\
	The assumed polarity of each resistor is such that the positive pole, 
	denoted as '$(+)$', is on the:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Right side of $R_1$;
		\item Left side of $R_2$;
		\item Right;
		\item Left;
		\item Right.
	\end{enumerate}
	Via Kirschoff's Voltage Law(KVL),
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mesh-3}
		-24\text{V} + R_1(I_1-I_3) + R_4(I_3-I_2) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mesh-1}
		R_2I_1 + R_3(I_1-I_2) - R_1(I_1-I_3) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mesh-2}
		R_3(I_1-I_2) + R_4(I_3-I_2) - R_5I_2 = 0
	\end{equation}
	First, we solve for $I_2$ in terms of the other currents using 
	equation(\ref{eq:mesh-2}).
	$$ R_3I_1+R_4I_3-I_2(R_3 + R_4 + R_5) = 0$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:cur_2-in-cur_1-cur_3}
		I_2 = \frac{R_3I_1 + R_4I_3}{650\Omega}
	\end{equation}
	Now we substitute '$I_2$' in equations (\ref{eq:mesh-1}) and 
	(\ref{eq:mesh-3}) with the right hand side of the above equation.
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:mesh-3}}
		-24\text{V} + R_1(I_1-I_3) + R_4I_3- \frac{6}{13}(R_3I_1 + R_4I_3) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{eq:mesh-1}}
		R_2I_1 + R_3I_1-\frac{2}{13}(R_3I_1 + R_4I_3) - R_1(I_1-I_3) = 0
	\end{equation}
	Via equation (\ref{eq:mesh-1}) we can solve for $I_1$ in terms of $I_3$.
	$$ I_1\left(R_2+R_3-\frac{2}{13}-R_1 \right)=I_3 \left( R_4 
	\frac{2}{13}-R_1\right)$$
	$$ -\frac{2}{13}I_1 = -103.85I_3$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:mesh_1-in-mesh_3}
		I_1 = 675 \cdot I_3
	\end{equation}
	Via the above equation, equation (\ref{eq:mesh-3}, and substitution, we can 
	solve for $I_3$.
	$$ -24\text{V} + 674\cdot R_1I_3 + R_4I_3 - \frac{6}{13}I_3(675\cdot 
	R_3+R_4)=0$$
	$$ 24\text{V} = 70107 \Omega \cdot I_3$$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:meshcur_3}
		I_3 = 0.34\text{mA}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:meshcur_1}
		I_1 = 231.07\text{mA}
	\end{equation}
	Via the above two equation, equation (10) and substitution,
	\begin{equation}\label{key}
	I_2 = 35.71\text{mA}
	\end{equation}
	That leaves us with the mesh current, but what about the measure of the 
	current flowing through each resistor, each denoted as '$I_{Ri}$', where 
	$i$ is the subscript or index of the associated resistor?
	$$ I_{R1} = I_3 - I_1 = -230.73\text{mA}$$
	Current $I_1$ is subtracted from the total since it's direction opposes the 
	polarity of $R_1$, while the direction of $I_3$ is added to the total 
	current since it's direction is not opposed to the polarity. \\ \\
	The fact that the obtained value is negative implies that our initial 
	assumption about the polarity was false;  As it turns out, the positive 
	pole is on the left hand side of $R_1$.  This means that $I_{R1}$ flows 
	toward and enters the node connecting $R_1$, $B_1$, and $R_2$. \\ \\
	Furthermore, note that, while the values we obtained for the three mesh 
	currents differ from those found on allaboutcircuits.com, the origin of 
	this example problem, we still arrived to roughly the same value for the 
	current flowing through $R_1$. \\ \\
	As for current $I_{R2}$, according to our initial assumptions, 
	$I_{R2}=I_1$, but is this consistent with the following equation that's 
	based on the vector value (i.e. both the magnitude and the direction the 
	current is flowing in) of $I_{R1}$, $I_3$, and KCL:
	$$ I_{R1} + I_3 - I_{R2} = 0$$
	As it turns out it is since, by reversing the polarity of $R_1$ and 
	subsequently the direction of $I_{R1}$, the once negative value of $I_{R1}$ 
	becomes positive;  The magnitude stays same, but the direction of the 
	current no long opposes the polarity of $R_1$, hence the value becoming 
	positive.
	$$ I_{R2} = I_1 = I_{R1} + I_3 = 230.73\text{mA} + 0.34\text{mA} = 
	231.07\text{mA}$$
